# 🚀 PromptBase — Full-Stack Architecture & AI Integration

This is a full-stack web application designed to demonstrate robust backend architecture, secure data flow, and modern API logic.

The project was intentionally structured to prioritise **backend ownership and system design**, while leveraging **AI-assisted tooling** to accelerate UI scaffolding. This allowed me to focus my engineering effort on the core of the application: building, integrating, and reasoning about the logic that powers the experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend (100% Manual Implementation)
* **Source Code:** [View Backend Repository](https://github.com/Shahan15/PromptBase)
* **Architecture:** Custom-built logic focused on scalability, clarity, and separation of concerns.
* **API Layer:** Fully owned end-to-end data handling, validation, and custom route design using Python/FastAPI.
* **Logic:** All business logic and database integration decisions were made and implemented independently.

### Frontend (AI-Accelerated & Manually Refined)
* **Frameworks:** Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
* **Process:** UI scaffolding was AI-assisted to speed up layout creation. All generated code was critically reviewed, refactored, and integrated manually to ensure alignment with backend contracts.

> **Note:** The use of AI was strictly a productivity choice for the frontend interface. All system architecture, security implementation, and integration decisions remain my sole responsibility.

## 🧠 Why This Approach?

In modern engineering environments, AI is a force multiplier, not a replacement for judgment. This project reflects that reality by:
- **Prioritising API-First Thinking:** Ensuring clean, type-safe communication between layers.
- **Focusing on System Correctness:** Maintaining full responsibility for data integrity and security.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Demonstrating the ability to modify and extend generated code to meet specific project requirements.
